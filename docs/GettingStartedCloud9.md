# Getting Started with Personalens and Cloud9

In order to allow you to experiment with Amazon Personalize in a contained
environment we will use Amazon's cloud based IDE Cloud9. This environment
will serve as your platform for developing and running the Personalens application
as well as a hosting platform for Jupyter notebooks to configure Amazon Personalize.
