# Loading Data Into Amazon Personalize

Just like the previous phase where you used a Jupyter Notebook to do most of the work, in this step you will open the notebook 
`Personalize_Sample_with_DB.ipynb` and follow the steps outlined there.

Once you have completed the notebook you can move onto [Integrating Amazon Personalize with Django](IntegratingAmazonPersonalizeWithDjango.md)
